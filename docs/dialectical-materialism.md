# Dialectical Materialism

## Dialectics
Marxist dialectics is descended from Hegelian dialectics, which are spelled out in Hegel's _Science of Logic_[^1]. While this is an important work for deeper study of Marx's philosophy and history, we can skip it for now. 

Hegel developed a three-sided **abstract-negative-concrete** model, often misrepresented as **thesis-antithesis-synthesis**. Hegel's model was refined further by Marx and applied to a materialist study of history. The Marxist three-part model can be summarized as follows:

1. Everything must be considered in relation to its conditions.
2. The thing itself contains internal contradictions and a tendency towards some resolution.
3. The thing contains the means of its own destruction in its contradictions.

(Marx and Engels considered Hegel's model too abstract, as Hegel was a German Idealist, and Marx especially developed the application to the material world as opposed to abstract thought.)

An example of a contradiction inherent in 21st century capitalism: more and more people who live in the country are driven off their land capitalist consolidation of land ownership in rural areas. Unable to find adequate waged work in nearby towns, these people flock to cities to find work. As a result, they come into contact with others like them and they become more and more aware of their own exploitation. 

The increasing concentration of the working class in cities will make it easier for them to mobilize and organize against the capitalist class: the urban mobilization in St Petersburg was in fact an important precondition for the 1917 Russian Revolution. Marx described conditions like these as an effect of the "law of increasing immiseration." 

The full readings on Marxist dialectics can be found in _Capital, Volume 1_[^2] and Engels' _Dialectics of Nature_[^3], but these are not necessary for understanding the core concepts. Marx and Engels developed their analysis of history based on the dialectical idea of **contradictions** inherent in any society. 

## Historical Materialism
In applying dialectics to a materialist view of the world, Marx and Engels rejected the Hegelian view of a **world spirit** leading to some inevitable conclusion, while maintaining that one could analyze history from material conditions and the contradictions contained within. 

Through this, Marx concluded that human history can be described primarily as a series of class struggles between competing groups. Class membership is defined by the person's relationship to the means of production, the way in which a given society turns natural resources into usable materials and goods.

As a materialist view of the world, dialectical/historical materialism rejects the notion that history is the result of a series of competing ideals. In the materialist view, events take place as the result of material conditions. For example, feudalism did not rise in Europe because it was a popular philosophy among the masses, but because of the historical development of Europe after the collapse of the population-depleted Western Roman empire. 

The technological level, population density, and natural conditions led to the development of serfdom, individual producers, and then the eventual rise of the capitalist class. Each stage of history contains within itself the seeds of its own destruction. Feudalism contained the conditions that led to the growth of a class of merchants and producers capable of selling the excess labor, the goods created beyond personal use (commodities), of other workers.

Similarly, the fact that Latin America seems to "lag behind" the global North in terms of industrial development has its roots in colonial plunder by Europe of Latin America's natural resources and labor potential. This process, like the expropriation of European peasants from their land, is called "primitive accumulation." Primitive accumulation of riches and property allowed protocapitalists in Europe to turn their newfound wealth to creating factories, investing in technological innovations, and then exporting their cheaply made goods to their former colonies in the South, choking off those countries' nascent production of similar goods. (See Eduardo Galeano's magisterial materialist history "The Open Veins of Latin America.")

While not all of the stages of history originally theorized by Marx or Engels are seen as correct today, their analysis of feudalism and capitalism has held up to intense ideological scrutiny.

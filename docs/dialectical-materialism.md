# Dialectical Materialism

## Dialectics
Marxist dialectics is descended from Hegelian dialectics, spelled out in the _Science of Logic_[^1]. While an important work for deeper study of Marx's philosophy and history, we can skip it for now. The key takeaway is the three sided model of **abstract-negative-concrete**, often misrepresented as **thesis-antithesis-synthesis**. This model is developed further by Marx and applied to a materialist study of history. Marx and Engels considred Hegel's model too abstract, as Hegel was a German Idealist, and Marx especially developed the application to the material world as opposed to abstract thought.

The full readings on Marxist dialectics can be found in _Capital, Volume 1_[^2] and Engel's _Dialectics of Nature_[^3], but these are not necessary for understanding the core concepts. Marx and Engels developed their analysis of history based on the dialectical idea of **contradictions** inherent in any society. Instead of the **abstract-negative-concrete** model, they developed a three part model that can be summarized as follows:

1. Everything must be considered in its relation to it's conditions.
2. The thing itself contains internal contradictions and a tendency towards some resolution.
3. The thing contains the means of its own destruction (in its contradictions).

## Historical Materialism
In applying dialectics to a materialist view of the world, Marx and Engels rejected the Hegelian view of a **world spirit** leading to some inevitable conclusion, while maintaining that one could analyze history from material conditions and the contradictions contained within. Through this, Marx concluded that human history can be described primarily as a series of class struggles between competing groups, where class is defined by the relationship to the means of production, the way in which a given society turns natural resources into usable materials and goods.

As a materialist view of the world, dialectica/historical materialism rejects the notion that history is the result of a series of competing ideals, but is instead the result of material conditions. For example, feudalism did not rise in Europe because it was a popular philosophy among the masses, but because of the historical development of Europe after the collapse of the population depleted Western Roman empire. The technological level, population density, and natural conditions led to the development of serfdom, individual producers, and then the eventual rise of the capital class. Each stage of history contains within itself the seeds of its own destruction. Feudalism contained the conditions that led to the growth of a class of merchants and producers capable of selling the excess labor, the goods created beyond personal use (commodities), of other workers.

While not all of the stages of history originally theorized by Marx or Engels are seen as correct today, the analysis of feudalism and capitalism has held up to intense ideological scrutiny.

For example, feudalism did not rise in Europe because it was a popular philosophy among the masses, but because of the historical development of Europe after the collapse of the population depleted Western Roman empire. The technological level, population density, and natural conditions led to the development of serfdom, individual producers, and then the eventual rise of the capital class.
